/**
 * How Reactime extracts useState data and what would have to be done
 * to extract useContext and useReducer data:
 *
 * When extracting a functional component's useState data from the fiber tree in the backend of
 * Reactime, said data is stored on said component's fiber tree node at its memoizedState property,
 * which is a linked list with each node holding data for each useState invocation (some but
 * not all other hooks also store nodes with data here). Each useState memoizedState node includes
 * the variable (e.g. user) and its corresponding dispatch function (e.g. setUser). This dispatch
 * function is required to use Reactime's timeJump feature.
 *
 * useContext data is stored on the property "dependencies", and only the data passed into the
 * value attritibute of the 'context'.Provider element will be there. For tripContext.Provider,
 * we pass down "trip" without "setTrip", so we won't have access to the 'trip' dispatch function
 * in the "IncrementWithMoreHooks" component, meaning Reactime's timeJump won't work without
 * finding the 'trip' dispatch function by coming into this component where useState was invoked and
 * storing it in the appropriate place. This is easy enough for useState variables, but useContext
 * is commonly used with useReducer which is an entirely different beast.
 *
 * I advise solving the puzzle of making useReducer work with the timeJump functionality before
 * integrating other hooks. Look at time jumping in the Redux dev tools chrome extension for
 * inspiration, because you essentially need to recreate that within Reactime.
